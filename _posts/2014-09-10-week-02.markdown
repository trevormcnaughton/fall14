### Introduction to Illustrator
Illustrator is a super powerful drawing program. It is part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, and will be the first application we learn to use. It is mostly used to draw illustrations, cartoons, logos, and interfaces. It uses mathematical equations to draw lines, shapes, and colors. Meaning anything you make with illustrator is scalable without any loss of resolution. Below is the basic rundown of what we will cover first. Don't worry, things will get more exciting

First we will create a new document. `File` > `New` and make a new Letter Document (8.5x11 inches). We will just use the default settings for now.

Alternatively, you can open an image file within Illustrator via `File` > `Open`

Let's take a look at some of the User Interface (UI). There's a lot here and you won't be expected to memorize all of it right away. This toolbar is going to be one of your best friends over the next few weeks. Get to know it, and love it.

### ACTIVITY TIME
Lets make some faces with the basic Illustrator tools. Using only the line tool, and shape tools, lets put together a few quick faces.

Try playing with different stroke thicknesses, and different shape sizes.

### Shape Faces
What was difficult about it? Were the rules helpful or too much of a constraint?
