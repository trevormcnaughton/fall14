### Gestalt Theory
> "The whole is other than the sum of the parts” - Kurt Koffka

Is the basis of how we visually perceive objects. In essence, when we see a group of objects, we perceive the whole before we consider it’s parts. And even when we look at the parts we want to group them as a whole.

#### Key Properties
**Emergence** – Is basically pattern recognition. We see the outline of a shape, identify that shape, then we begin to recognize the parts that make up the whole.

**Reification** – Is filling in the gaps. If there isn’t enough visual data present we will make up that in our minds to create a meaningful image.

**Multi-stability** – Describes what our mind does when it sees two things within one image. We cannot focus on both images, so we only see one at a time.

</figure>

**Invariance** – The ability to recognize shapes at various angles. This is due to our seeing things in three dimensions. We’ve adapted to recognizing in different contexts.

Dang, those are some crazy words.

### Gestalt Principles
Almost everything we do in graphic design is summarized in these theories and principles. Understanding all of the principles below will make you an ultimate design badass.

> “People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form(s) possible.”

- Law of Prägnanz
- Closure
- Symmetry & Order
- Figure/Ground
- Uniform Connectedness
- Common Regions
- Proximity
- Continuation
- Common Fate
- Parallelism
- Similarity
- Focal Points
- Past Experiences

### The Pen Tool
That's enough concepts for now. Let's dig into one of Illustrators most powerful features. The Pen tool.
