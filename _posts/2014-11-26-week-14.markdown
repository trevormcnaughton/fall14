### Work Time
 Today we'll have a mega productive work session (because I bet some of you could use it :D). Feel free to ask me any questions, now is your chance, BECAUSE IT'S THE LAST CLASS NEXT WEEK.

<aside>ALSO: Some of ya'll have been leaving early during worktime. That's not cool, and is actually considered late on your attendance if you havent cleared it with me! So, let's not do that today.</aside>
