### Agenda
- Animation
- In a UI
- Some Cool Stuff
- Activity / Quick Tip

### Making things move
So far we've worked mostly in two dimensions and almost exclusively with computer screens. But today, we shall travel straight past the third dimension and **INTO THE FOURTH**. Time.
![Time](http://www.gimpbible.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/gimpbible-f1901.gif)
_XYZTime_

Time is so interesting because it describes how things go from here to there, and change from this to that. It helps our brains think about states, changes, adding, subtracting. It helps us rationalize things happening on the screen by giving our feeble minds feedback.

Movement also creates delight, when done correctly. When done poorly it makes you cringe. It is souless and gross, and often is because computers interpolate movement in a straight line.

> Computers are jerks and love to fill in the gaps linearly because they are lazy sacks of wires.

Can you think of an animation either in an app, or a game, or a movie, that made you feel awesome? Or is just straight up awesome?

### Disney
Disney was the pioneer of animation, and the 12 fundamentals that Disney created still hold true for modern animators today (both in cartooning, interface, motion graphics, and game). Those 12 principles are:

1. Squash and stretch
2. Anticipation
3. Staging
4. Straight ahead action and pose to pose
5. Follow through and overlapping action
6. Slow in and slow out
7. Arcs
8. Secondary action
9. Timing
10. Exaggeration
11. Solid drawing
12. Appeal

The intersection of graphic design, and animation is basically motion graphics. It is very much what the name sounds like. The popularization of motions graphics has been helped by mainstream applications like After Effects, and Cinema 4D. Both applications make it easier for designers to create pretty moving shapes, and characters.

### Animation in UI

_Designing With Motion: Pasquale D'Silva_

One of the most important jobs for animation in our interface is to give us important feedback on what is happening to the UI in front of you. What does a button do when you press it? How does the next screen in an interface come in? Does it just appear? Or does it scale in and up from the bottom? Animation reveals information about where things come from, and how they work. It is a very important piece in helping users understand how things work. Animation provides cues.

[Google Design – Authentic Motion](http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html)
Google thinks that animation should feel authentic. That it should be responsive and make the interface feel more alive. They do so in a number of ways, but mostly updating and changing the interface when a user interacts with elements.

There's a lot happening in that video, but pay attention to where things are coming from, how elements are responding, and how animation is assisting in the understanding of the interface.

#### Oh and Games!

### Easing & Cushoning
Easing is a huge part of making animation feel more organic and fluid. Things IRL don't just move from here to there at the exact same pace. When you drop a ball on the ground it accellerates. It's animation quickens as it approaches the ground because gravity is pulling on it.

### Activity / Tip
Simple easing in After Effects!!!!! We will do this together, and bear with me. I haven't used AE in a while...

### Work on Finals
We will use the rest of class as time to work on our finals. Ask me questions, and no you can't leave early because I know you have stuff you can work on.

### Next week
**NOTE** Next week we will not have class, because Thanksgiving and I'll be travelling. **THIS DOES NOT MEAN** you can slack for a week. You will be expected to complete any work I assign, and to go through what we are covering on your own. I also will need to see progress on what you will be doing for your final projects. You will be expected to turn in your progress on Moodle so I can see how your projects are coming along. Also, don't forget that **these steps are graded towards your final!** If you are late with your check-ins this will affect your grade on your final. If it is unclear what we discussed for your check-in see me and we can get it squared away.
