### Disney
Disney was the pioneer of modern animation, and the 12 fundamentals that Disney created still hold true for animators today (both in cartooning, and interface).

- Squash and stretch
- Anticipation
- Staging
- Straight ahead action and pose to pose
- Follow through and overlapping action
- Slow in and slow out

- Arcs
- Secondary action
- Timing
- Exaggeration
- Solid drawing
- Appeal

### Making things move
So far we've worked mostly in two dimensions and almost exclusively with computer screens. But today, we shall travel straight past the third dimension and **INTO THE FOURTH**. Time. How do things get from here to there? Or go from this to that?

Movement creates delight, when done correctly.

- [Google Design â€“ Authentic Motion](http://www.google.com/design/spec/animation/authentic-motion.html)
Google things that animation should feel authentic. That it should be responsive and make the interface feel more alive. They do so in a number of ways, but mostly updating and changing the interface when a user ineteracts with elements.

There's a lot happening in that video, but pay attention to where things are coming from, how elements are responding, and how animation is assisting in the understanding of the interface.

#### Animation in UI & Game

#### Easing
Easing is a huge part of making animation feel more organic and fluid. Things IRL don't just move from here to there at the exact same pace. When you drop a ball on the ground it accellerates. It's animation quickens as it approaches the ground because gravity is pulling on it.

### Activity
Simple easing in After Effects
