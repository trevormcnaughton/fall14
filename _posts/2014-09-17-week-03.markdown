- Activity
- Start Project 1

# First, Color Theory
Color. Color is a HUGE huge huge concept. Actually both color and type are huge huge huge concepts. But, we are gonna tackle them both since **YOU DEFINITELY ALL READ THE COLOR CHAPTER SO I DON'T EVEN REALLY NEED TO COVER THIS VERY MUCH RIGHT?** And because we are awesome.

<ul class="large-block-grid-3 small-block-grid-1">
  <li>
    <h4>Color Wheel</h4>
    <p>Shows relationships between colors. All dem colors.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/hue.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Primary Colors</h4>
    <p>These are mixed to make all other colors. Can’t be made from other colors.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/primary.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Secondary Colors</h4>
    <p>Two primary colors mixed together create secondary colors.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/secondary.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Tertiary Colors</h4>
    <p>Created with one primary and one secondary color mixed together.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/tertiary.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Complementary</h4>
    <p>Opposite each other on the color wheel. Think Christmas, Da Bears, or The Lakers</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/complimentary.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Analogous Colors</h4>
    <p>In the same section, or very near each other, on the color wheel.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/analogous.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>
</ul>

### Color Attributes

- **Hue:** An element of the color wheel (ROYGBV)

- **Intensity:** How bright or dull a color is. Intensity changes with a change in saturation, shading, and/or tinting.

- **Saturation:** Purity of a color when neutralizing to grey.

- **Value:** How light or dark the color is.

- **Shade:** hue + black

- **Tint:** hue + white


### Color Models (aka Color Space)

- **CMYK:** Cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. Printing/pigments. Subtractive (pigments absorb light, subtracting certain wavelengths of light from our visible spectrum)

- **RGB:** Red, green, blue. On screen. Additive. All three colors at full strength creates white light, while black is the absence of light.


### Color Effects

- **Bezold Effect:** Optical mixing, an optical illusion wherein a color appears lighter or darker based on what color it is adjacent to.

- **Vibration and Value:** A color placed on another color close in value can appear to “glow”

# And now: Type

<ul class="large-block-grid-2 small-block-grid-1">
  <li>
    <h4>Typeface</h4>
    <p>A family of fonts. AKA All of Avenir is the Typeface, a font is Avenir Light</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/typeface.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Size</h4>
    <p>Size refers to how big the font is in a unit of measure. </p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/font-size.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Weight</h4>
    <p>The weight of the font, usually defined as light, regular, or bold.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/font-weight.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Tracking</h4>
    <p>Defines the space between characters in a word. This is not the same as Kerning.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/tracking.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Leading</h4>
    <p>Is the space between lines of text. Imagine a strip of lead resting between the lines</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week3/leading.png" alt="" />
    </figure>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Kerning</h4>
    <p>The space between individual characters. <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3035334/fast-feed/esurance-learns-an-expensive-lesson-on-why-kerning-matters">This is why kerning matters</a></p>

### Type has personality
Every typeface has a personality, and an opnion. Sometimes, just like with real people, different faces will have stronger personality traits. Eitheway any typeface will be able to tell a story about itself.

  <figcaption>Lust Didone is super regal</figcaption>
  </img>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/week3/type-sturdy.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Merriweather is a solid typeface</figcaption>
  </img>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/week3/type-overt.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Some are very unique</figcaption>
  </img>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/week3/type-stylized.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>Duke is very unique, and strong</figcaption>
  </img>
</figure>

<figure>
  <img src="/images/week3/type-comical.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>I had to...</figcaption>
  </img>
</figure>

When choosing a typeface you really need to think about the message you want to get across. You aren't going to write going to make a metal show poster in comic sans. Unless you are a super troll.

### Type in Illustrator
Typograpy in Illustrator is another strong use-case for it's popularity, and power. Here is a breakdown of the Type Tool Palette

### ACTIVITY TIME
Type out your favorite movie / game / whatever quote and we will set (set is the fancymans word for making type look good) it in illustrator.

>Goonies never say die. / Do the truffle shuffle.

Two quotes from my favorite movie. Someone else in this room better love this movie...
