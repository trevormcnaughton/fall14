### Description
In keeping with the remix theme, we are going to remix a game about remixing. We will be re-mixing each others works in the ultimate collaborative showdown. The basic idea is that one person starts the collaboration, then they hand it off to their partner. The partner then takes what is already there and changes it a bit by adding more elements, removing elements, changing the colors, editing the message. Anything goes. It's kind of like a digital exquisite corpse. Here's how it will work.

I'll assign you a partner with the [create-a-partner-tron](/create-a-partner/)

1. Swap contact information with your partner **COMMUNICATION IS KEY**
2. Choose a broad theme to base the concept (Space, Cereal, Music, Games, TV, Philosophy)
3. Flip a coin to determine who goes first
4. The person that lost the coin toss will create a new .PSD that is 1000px wide x 480px high @ 72PPI and start the composition.
5. When they have completed their first 'Volley' **Make sure to keep all your layers**, they will save that file and send it off to their partner.
6. The partner will receive the PSD and take what has been made and add a few things, remove some things, change some things. Then send it back.
7. You will do this 5 times each.
8. Try to keep some similar themes throughout the process.

#### Don't be a meanie and let your partner down.

### Requirements
- Photoshop document that is 1000px wide x 480px high @ 72PPI
- **Important!** Save each volley as a new file! And number them in the filename!
  - `name-partnername-layer-tennis-01.psd`, `name-partnername-layer-tennis-02.psd` ETC. I need to see each step of the process.
- 5 volleys each (10 total .PSD files)

### Submitting Homework
This is not due next week, this is due November 5th! But you should be working on this together in that time. Remember that your success relies on your partner as well so don't leave them hanging.
For submission we will use the Google Drive again because that worked out nice last time. I'll create a Project 2 folder. And it might work out well to just work out of this folder with your partner so you don't have to email things back and forth.

1. Create a folder within Project 2 with you and your partners names
2. Add your files into that folder
3. Rejoice
