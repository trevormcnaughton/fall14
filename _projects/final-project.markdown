### Description
Alright, here is the deal. You will be acting as lead designer, creative director, art director, game designer, whatever you want for the final. Since all of you have such diverse backgrounds, and majors, we will do something different for the final project. You will be proposing what you want to do for your finals. **This proposal will be due by November 12th**. And you will be required to write at least **two paragraphs** about what you want to do for your final, **and why**. Your finals will need to be relevant to this class, and will have to encompass things you've learned during this class.

Specific requirements will be added when you present your proposal to me. We will assess what you'll be handing in during a 1:1 chat about your final project proposal. And then we will go from there!

### Requirements
- Proposal
- Use either Photoshop or Illustrator
- Any other requirements will be on a per-student basis.
