### Submitting Homework
Using any FTP client, upload your assignments to the class folder. The instructions below will help you get started with FTP. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) is a decent free FTP client, I use [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/). It's not free but it's super well designed, and awesome.

#### Steps to FTP
- Open FTP application of choice
- Enter `iam.colum.edu` into the `host` field
- Put your IAM username into `username`
- And your IAM password into `password`
