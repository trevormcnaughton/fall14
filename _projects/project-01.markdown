### Description
Get it? It's like interpretation, but with type. :D . This should be pretty simple. Take your all time favorite movie, or videogame cover and reimagine it using only type, color, and basic shapes. Break it down to it's bare essentials, and focus on one piece that could describe the whole thing.

### Goals
The goal with this assignment is to learn how to communicate using the simplest tools you have in your design toolbelt. How much of the cover can you get rid of while still making it interesting while also preserving the message and tone of the content? And it should be something you'd hang on your wall!
