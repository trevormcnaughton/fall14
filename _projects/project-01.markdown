### Description
Take your all time favorite movie, videogame, or book cover and reimagine it using only type, color, and basic shapes. Break it down to it's bare essentials, and focus on one piece that could describe the whole thing. So the requirements are:
- Display title of the book, movie, game
- (Optional) Display Author, sub-headline, or quote
- One strong and defining visual element from the plot

### Goals
The goal with this assignment is to learn how to communicate using the simplest tools you have in your design toolbelt. How much of the cover can you get rid of while still making it interesting while also preserving the message and tone of the content? And it should be something you'd hang on your wall! Use all of the tools that you've aquired in the last few weeks!

### Requirements
- 11in x 17in (Standard poster size)
- Utilize type, color, shape
- One strong visual element that describes a core concept of the plot.

### Submitting Homework
- For next week (9/24): I want to see sketches of your poster concepts. These can be digital sketches, but I'd prefer that you grab a pen/pencil and start scratching on some real paper. You'll churn through ideas a lot faster. They don't have to be perfect completed sketches, but they should illustrate your concept.
- For the week after next (10/1): Print these on 11x17 paper, we will hang them on the wall and talk about them in class after next week.
- For the week after next (10/1): Submit the finished Illustrator file via Moodle (Since FTP isn't awesome)
