### Agenda
- Homework Review / Critique 
- Gestalt Theory
- Gestalt Principles
- Pen tool activity

### Gestalt Theory
> "The whole is other than the sum of the parts” - Kurt Koffka

The Gestalt theory is the basis of how we visually perceive objects. In essence, when we see a group of objects, we perceive the whole before we consider it’s parts. And even when we look at the parts we want to group them as a whole.

### Key Properties - AKA The list of crazy words

<ul class="large-block-grid-2 small-block-grid-1">

  <li>
    <h4>Emergence</h4>
    <p>Is basically pattern recognition. We see the outline of a shape, identify that shape, then we begin to recognize the parts that make up the whole.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week2/emergence.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>What shape emerges?</figcaption>
      </img>
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Reification</h4>
    <p>Is filling in the gaps. If there isn’t enough visual data present we will make up the missing information in our minds to create something meaningful.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week2/reification.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>Shapes without a definitive shape</figcaption>
      </img>
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Multi-stability</h4>
    <p>Describes what our mind does when it sees two things within one image. We cannot focus on both images, so we only see one at a time.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week2/multistability.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>One or two images?</figcaption>
      </img>
    </figure>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Invariance</h4>
    <p>The ability to recognize shapes at various angles. This is due to our seeing things in three dimensions. We’ve adapted to recognizing in different contexts.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="/images/week2/invariance.png" alt="">
      <figcaption>It's always a box with a hole in it</figcaption>
      </img>
    </figure>
  </li>
</ul>

### Gestalt Principles
Almost everything we do in graphic design is summarized in these theories and principles. Understanding all of the principles below will make you an ultimate design badass.

> “People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form(s) possible.”

<ul class="large-block-grid-4 small-block-grid-1">
  <li>
    <h4>Law of Prägnanz</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/law-of-pragnanz.png" />
    <p>The fundamental principle, we prefer simple, clear, and ordered images. They take less time to recognize and are easier to interperet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Closure</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/closure.png" />
    <p>We generally look for a single recognizable pattern in images. Often completing images where there may be missing information.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Figure / Ground</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/figure-ground.png" />
    <p>Elements are perceived as either in focus (the foreground of the images) or resting (the background).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Uniform Connectedness</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/uniform-connectedness.png" />
    <p>Similar elements, line, shape, and color grouped together can be visually connected as a whole.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Good Continuation</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/good-continuation.png" />
    <p>Elements appearing in a line or a curve are percieved to be more related than elements not on the line or curve.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Common Fate</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/common-fate.gif" />
    <p>We tend to percieve images moving in the same direction as being more related. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Proximity</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/proximity.png" />
    <p>Things that are close to each other are more easily relatable than things that are not close.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>Similarity</h4>
    <img src="/images/week2/similarity.png" />
    <p>Things that are similar to each other are more easily relatable than things that are not similar.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

### The Pen Tool
That's enough concepts for now. Let's dig into one of Illustrators most powerful features. The Pen tool.

  <figcaption>This should probably be a t-shirt</figcaption>
  </img>
</figure>

#### Breaking down the pen tool
It's a funny thing. It's simultaneously one of the most powerful tools in Illustrator and it starts out kind of complex, but then becomes really simple and intuitive. The first thing to understand is the Bezier Curve!
<figure>
  <img src="/images/week2/bezier-curve.png" alt="">
  <figcaption>All them curves</figcaption>
  </img>
</figure>

The Bezier Curve is the main reason the pen tool was so innovative when Illustrator first came out. It allowed artists to create accurate, curvy, organic lines in a pretty easy way. Let's talk really quick about some of the different options within the pen tool.

### ACTIVITY TIME
Using the Pen Tool. We are going to run through a quick and dirty pen tool exercise. [Download This File](/files/week2/Pen_Tool_The_Exercise.ai), open it up in illustrator, and we should be good to go.
