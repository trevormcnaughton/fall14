</ul>

<h3 id="critique">Critique</h3>
<p>Today’s critique will be a bit different. We are going to pair up to critique 2 of the 5 sets of images. We will take 15 minutes to analyze and write about our partner’s images. After we write about them you will share your feedback with each other. <em>Ready</em>. <em>Set</em>. <em>Go</em>.</p>

<h3 id="semiotics">Semiotics</h3>
<p>Generally speaking semiotics is a fancy word for the study of signs. Well, that’s cool… But what’s a sign? Signs are actually fairly complex. They are made up of any number of components – words, sounds, body language and context. Combined these create a sweet visual language that help us navigate the world, or read a human being.</p>

<aside>Semioticians (yes there's a job for that) do this for a living.. They study signs and how they create meaning. They figure out how meaning can be derived from different cultural, or personal experience.</aside>

<h4 id="icon-index-and-symbols">Icon, Index, and Symbols</h4>
<p>Of course, since there are people devoted to studying semiotics, someone was bound to classify, and categorize this stuff. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce">this guy</a> was that guy back in the early 1900s <img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/58/Charles_Sanders_Peirce.jpg" alt="This one guy" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To say, therefore, that thought cannot happen in an instant, but requires a time, is but another way of saying that every thought must be interpreted in another, or that all thought is in signs.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul class="large-block-grid-3 small-block-grid-1">
  <li>
    <h4>Icon</h4>
    <p>An Icon sign is a sign that resembles something, such as photographs of people. An icon can also be illustrative or diagrammatic, for example a ‘no-smoking’ sign.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Index</h4>
    <p>An Index signs are signs where there is a direct link between the sign and the object. The majority of traffic signs are Index signs as they represent information which relates to a location (eg, a ‘slippery road surface’ sign placed on a road which is prone to flooding)</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h4>Symbols</h4>
    <p>A symbol has no logical meaning between it and the object. Unfortunately the web is littered with bad examples of this type of sign, but there are good ones - a homepage icon which is a house for example. Other off screen symbols which may help explain the difference are flags. Flags are symbols which represent countries or organisations. Again, the crossover to design and branding is very evident in these signs.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="signifier-vs-signified">Signifier vs Signified</h4>
<p>There is also another, arguably simpler, way to classify signs. Signifier, and signified. Or basically what the sign looks like, and what the sign means.</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>‘Signifier’</strong> - what it looks like</li>
  <li><strong>‘Signified’</strong> - what it means</li>
</ol>

We are going to split up into 4 groups and research one of these 4 symbols / icons below. Create a simple presentation (using Illustrator or Photoshop) which covers the history of it, it’s classification, it’s signifier and signified. You will then share it with us all.</p>

<p><strong>Handicapped Icon</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peace Sign</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dollar Symbol</strong></p>

<p><strong>Red Cross Emblem</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Talk about it’s origins, how did it become culturally or historically relevant?</li>
  <li>It’s sign classification (Icon, Index, Symbol)</li>
  <li>It’s Signifier (What form does it take)</li>
  <li>It’s Signified (What concept does it represent)</li>
</ul>
