<h3 id="the-remix">The Remix</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>A non-linear re-interpretation of a of a given work or media other than music</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You’ve heard of a remix before. It’s that version of a song that’s usually longer, more annoying, and bassier. Well, its roots are in music and back in the late 60’s and 70’s dancehall DJs would de-contsrturct popular music tracks and rebuild them to cater to their particular audiences. This reappropriation of other peoples sounds is what sparked the remix revolution. Remixes still permeate through the pop culture today, but, over the last 40 years the idea of the remix has been… remixed? o.O</p>

<h3 id="remixing-in-pop-culture">Remixing in Pop Culture</h3>

<p>Artists do this thing a lot where they take some ideas from other artists and build ideas off of them. It’s not uncommon to see references of art history in modern art, or throwbacks to older songs in pop music. But some artists have taken this idea to a whole new level. Andy Warhol was particularly fond of this. Most of his work revolved around reappropriating consumer goods, or pop culture references by way of almost blantantly copying them, while simultaneously changing the context in which they are viewed (Art gallery walls instead of corner store shelves).</p>

<h3 id="copyright--fair-use">Copyright &amp; Fair Use</h3>
<p>One extremely clear distinction to make with all of this talk about remixing and reappropriating is that it is <strong>ABSOLUTELY NOT</strong> synonymous with plagiarism. That is still very much illegal, and will infringe on most college rules and copyright laws. If you consider doing any remix-y type stuff there are a few super important things that you should study to save you from copyright infringement because going to jail is bad. The first is The Copyright Act.</p>

<aside><strong>The Copyright Act of 1976</strong> is a United States copyright law and remains the primary basis of copyright law in the United States, as amended by several later enacted copyright provisions. The Act spells out the basic rights of copyright holders, codified the doctrine of "fair use," and for most new copyrights adopted a unitary term based on the date of the author's death rather than the prior scheme of fixed initial and renewal terms. It became Public Law number 94-553 on October 19, 1976 and went into effect on January 1, 1978. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Act_of_1976">Source</a></aside>

<p>The next is Fair Use</p>

<aside><strong>Fair use</strong> is a limitation and exception to the exclusive right granted by copyright law to the author of a creative work. In United States copyright law, fair use is a doctrine that permits limited use of copyrighted material without acquiring permission from the rights holders. Examples of fair use include commentary, search engines, criticism, parody, news reporting, research, teaching, library archiving and scholarship. It provides for the legal, unlicensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author's work under a four-factor balancing test. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use">Source</a></aside>

<p>This guy <a href="http://www.tomforsythe.com/">Tom Forsythe</a> got sued by Mattel over the use of Barbie dolls in his project “Food Chain Barbie” but the case was dropped by Mattel because his use of the Barbies fell under the ‘parody’ clause of the Fair Use Act.</p>

<h3 id="activity-time--project-2---ping-pong">Activity Time / Project 2 - Ping Pong</h3>
<p>This is going to kick-off Project 2. We are going to do something similar to Layer Tennis but without the commentary, and competition. What exactly is Layer Tennis you might ask? Well… <a href="http://www.layertennis.com/">It’s this thing</a> that Jim Coudal and friends started a while ago here in Chicago. It has gotten really popular within the community and they are now on the 4th Season.</p>

<aside>Two competitors swap a file back and forth in real-time, adding to and embellishing the work. Each artist gets fifteen minutes to complete a “volley” and then we post that to the site live. A third participant, a writer, provides play-by-play commentary on the action as it happens.</aside>

<p>We are going to change the rules a little bit to make it better suited for our class. Check out <a href="/projects/project-02/">The Project 2 Page</a> for more info.</p>
