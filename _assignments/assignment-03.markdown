### Description
**Due: Oct 15th**

For this assignment I want you to re-frame the narrative of a set of photographs you will create. Take 5 photographs with any camera. Then crop each image in two different ways to alter the story that image is creating.

### Goal
Learn to use Photoshops crop tool while also learning how to compose photographic images using a grid. Learn how to tweak the narrative of a photograph by using the simple concepts of re-framing.

### Requirements
- 15 images total
	- 5 full frame images (Not cropped)
	- 2 unique crops of each image
- Upload to this google drive folder as a slideshow (Directions below)

### Snapping
If anyone shoots with their smartphones, there are a plethora of really powerful camera apps at your disposal. I use VSCOcam on my phone almost every day. It’s pretty great for shooting, editing, and uploading images. It’s also got some nice grid overlays that are super helpful for framing and cropping your images.
