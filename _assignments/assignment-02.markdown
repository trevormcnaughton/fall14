### Description
You know, #selfies. You will be the subject of this weeks homework. Using your cell phone, or camera, or computer camera take a sweet selfie. Make sure that it is lit well enough for you to be able to trace it in Illustrator!

### Requirements
- 8.5 x 11 file size
- .AI file format (Illustrators native format)
- The original photograph
- At least one complete image, you can do more if you really want.
- File name format should be the your firstname - last name - assignment name - assignment number ie `firstname-lastname-digital-sketches-a1.ai`
- No tool restrictions this time
- Think about gestalt! And work the principles into these assignments!

### Inspiration
Here are some ideas to get the gears turning.

#### Try experimenting with different styles.
You should make something that you think also looks cool. If you are super into pixel art, why not do a pixel inspired selifie? If you like simple illustrations, try and see how much detail you can remove from your portrait while still being recognizable. If you fancy yourself more of an expressive ar-teest, do something slightly more abstract. Also, be prepared to talk about how you incorporated some of the gestalt principles when we show the class.
