### Description
You know, #selfies. You will be the subject of this weeks homework. Using your cell phone, or camera, or computer camera take a sweet selfie. Get something iconic about Chicago in the background (for some figure ground relationship), and make sure that it is lit well enough for you to be able to trace it in Illustrator!

### Requirements
- 400pt x 400pt file size (In illustrator)
- At least one complete image, you can do more if you really want.
- File name format for Illustrator file should stick with the firstname - last name - assignment name - assignment number pattern. I.E. `firstname-lastname-selfies-a2.ai`
- No tool restrictions this time
- Think about gestalt! And work the principles into these assignments!

### Inspiration
Here are some ideas to get the gears turning.

#### Try experimenting with different styles.
You should make something that you think also looks cool. If you are super into pixel art, why not do a pixel inspired selifie? If you like simple illustrations, try and see how much detail you can remove from your portrait while still being recognizable. If you fancy yourself more of an expressive ar-teest, do something slightly more abstract. Also, be prepared to talk about how you incorporated some of the gestalt principles when we show the class.

Oh, one last thing, **have fun with it**!

### Submitting Homework
We will be submitting homework via Instagram. Whaaaaa? I mean it was basically built for #selfies amirite? Upload your finished assignment to Instagram and @ mention OR tag me so I know you did it (my Instagram handle is [@trvr](http://instagram.com/trvr)) and use the hashtag we create in class, #DIDzaparty139 (great work team).

#### Steps to getting from phone/camera <-> computer

1. Email, Text, Dropbox, USB, whatever you prefer just get the photo onto your computer.
2. In Illustrator go to `File -> Open` find your #selfie then click open.
3. Change your artboard size to a 400pt x 400pt square
4. Scale the image if you need to fit it inside the artboard.
5. Once you've got your image in place lock the layer your image is on, and create a new layer and name that layer "tracing".

6. Start tracin, when you've complete your vector traced selfie, go to `File -> Save for Web`
7. In the top right corner of this dialog select `JPEG` from the list of file formats, and increase your quality to 100%
