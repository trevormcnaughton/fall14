### Description
Using the techniques we discussed in class, and concepts from the Point, Line, and Plane readings. Create 9 digital sketches that express 9 different emotions, or design concepts. They can be abstract, but should only use simple shapes and lines to express.

### Requirements
- 8.5 x 11 file size
- .AI file format (Illustrators native format)
- All images in same document, use separate artboards
- 9 Different Images
- Color is not a requirement since we haven't talked about color theory yet
- File name format should be the your firstname - last name - assignment name - assignment number ie `firstname-lastname-digital-sketches-a1.ai`
- Line and shape tools only!

### Reading
Here is the week 1 reading. The first chapter is on me, but, GET THE BOOK! [Point, Line, and Plane](/files/week1/Point_Line_Plane_Week_1.pdf)

### Resources
Reference these [Lynda tutorials](http://www.lynda.com/Illustrator-tutorials/quick-tour-using-Illustrator/124100/148695-4.html) if you need any help with the interface, or the illustrator workspace. They are very thorough and highly recommended.


### Submitting Homework
Using any FTP client, upload your assignments to the class folder. The instructions below will help you get started with FTP. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) is a decent free FTP client, I use [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/). It's not free but it's super well designed, and awesome.

#### How to FTP
- [Reference this WIKI article to get started with FTP](http://imamp.colum.edu/mediawiki/index.php/FTP)
- Navigate to `/classfolders/DID/`
- Drop your assignment into the `36-1300-03_Trevor/` folder!
- Woo!
