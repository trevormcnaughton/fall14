### Requirements
- 8.5 x 11 file size
- .AI file format (Illustrators native format)
- All images in same document, use separate artboards
- 9 Different Images
- Color is not a requirement since we haven't talked about color theory yet
- Line and shape tools only!

### Description
Using the techniques we discussed in class, and concepts from the Point, Line, and Plane readings. Create 9 digital sketches that express 9 different emotions, or design concepts. They can be abstract, but should only use simple shapes and lines to express.

### Inspiration
Here are some ideas to get the gears turning.

### Submitting Homework
Using any FTP client, upload your assignments to the class folder. The instructions below will help you get started with FTP. [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client) is a decent free FTP client, I use [Transmit](http://panic.com/transmit/). It's not free but it's super well designed, and awesome.

#### Steps to FTP
- Open FTP application of choice
- Enter `iam.colum.edu` into the `host` field
- Put your IAM username into `username`
- And your IAM password into `password`
