### Description
**Due: Nov 19th**

Sorry I couldn't come up with a more clever title ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯  Create a grid system, and design a layout upon that system. Try playing with different grids, asymmetrical ones. Or even get a little Bauhaus and make it more wacky. The end result could be something like a poster, or a website. The important part is making a grid and designing on top of it. Show your work. I want to see the grid that you created, and how your elements align to that grid.

### Requirements
- Create your own grid system, using one of the styles we went over (Bauhaus, Swiss, or a web layout grid)
- Show your work! I want to see the grids
- If you are doing a poster make sure it's at least 8x10in
- If you are doing a website make sure it's 1280px wide by at least 800px high (A laptop screen)
- Hand in a .PSD or .AI so I can see your grid
- Upload your assignment to moodle
